## Introduction

The Advent of Code is an annual coding event that provides daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle is an opportunity to improve coding skills, explore new algorithms, and have fun solving problems. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 edition, all implemented in Rust.
